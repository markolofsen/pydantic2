# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for Pydantic2. Please note that this roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and project priorities.

## Current Version (1.0.x)

The current version of Pydantic2 focuses on providing a solid foundation for structured LLM responses with:

- Core client functionality for interacting with LLMs
- Structured response parsing with Pydantic models
- Basic usage tracking and statistics
- Simple agent system with tool support
- Integration with FastAPI and Django

## Short-term Goals (Next 3-6 Months)

### Enhanced Response Validation

- Improved validation of LLM responses against Pydantic models
- Better error handling and recovery for malformed responses
- Support for more complex nested models and validation rules

### Advanced Usage Tracking

- More detailed usage analytics and reporting
- Enhanced visualization of usage patterns
- Export capabilities for usage data

### Agent System Improvements

- More built-in tools for common tasks
- Support for multi-agent collaboration
- Memory and context management for agents

### Performance Optimizations

- Reduced latency for high-volume applications
- Optimized token counting and cost calculation
- Caching mechanisms for frequently used responses

## Medium-term Goals (6-12 Months)

### Advanced Model Management

- Support for fine-tuned models
- Model performance comparison tools
- Automated model selection based on task requirements

### Enterprise Features

- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant support
- Advanced budget management and alerts

### Expanded Framework Integrations

- Flask integration
- Streamlit integration
- Jupyter notebook extensions

### Developer Experience

- Improved documentation with more examples
- CLI tools for common tasks
- Visual debugging tools for response parsing

## Long-term Vision (Beyond 12 Months)

### AI Orchestration

- Complex workflows with multiple LLM calls
- Automated prompt optimization
- Hybrid systems combining multiple AI models

### Specialized Vertical Solutions

- Domain-specific extensions for legal, medical, financial applications
- Industry-specific response models and validation rules

### Community and Ecosystem

- Plugin system for community extensions
- Marketplace for sharing response models
- Integration with popular AI development platforms

## How to Influence the Roadmap

We welcome community input on our roadmap! To suggest features or changes:

1. Open an issue on GitHub with the "enhancement" label
2. Join our community discussions
3. Contribute code or documentation that aligns with the roadmap

For major feature requests, please provide:
- A clear description of the feature
- Use cases and benefits
- Any implementation ideas you may have

## Experimental Features

We maintain several experimental features that may be promoted to core functionality based on user feedback:

- Streaming response parsing
- Automatic prompt generation from models
- Response quality scoring

To try experimental features, check the documentation for the latest "experimental" package.
